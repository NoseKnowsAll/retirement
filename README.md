# Julia Retirement Simulator
Julia scripts to perform basic forecast of your personal retirement accounts.

Simply modify the personal information in `personal_info.jl` to reflect your personal retirement savings, and then create forecasts on your future retirement with the `model_retirement()` function. In the REPL, this is simply:

`include("retirement.jl")`
`model_retirement()`
